        That may be so, but you had no right to throw me over for anyone else’s
        sake.
    </p>
    <p>
        MRS LINDE.
        Indeed I don’t know. Many a time did I ask myself if I had the right to
        do it.

        KROGSTAD.
        _[more gently]_. When I lost you, it was as if all the solid ground
        went from under my feet. Look at me now—I am a shipwrecked man clinging
        to a bit of wreckage.

    <p>
        MRS LINDE.
        But help may be near.
    </p>
    <p>
        KROGSTAD.
        It was near; but then you came and stood in my way.
    </p>
    <p>
        MRS LINDE.
        Unintentionally, Nils. It was only today that I learned it was your
        place I was going to take in the Bank.
    </p>

        I believe you, if you say so. But now that you know it, are you not
        going to give it up to me?
